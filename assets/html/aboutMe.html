                I am pursuing Master’s degree in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC).
                I have over a couple of years of professional experience in software development which
                not only provided me with practical experience in SDLC and agile methodology
                but also gave me a strong hold on Data Structures and Algorithms.
                I am proficient with Java, Matlab, Python and experienced in building MEAN stack and Android applications.
            </p>

                Currently, I am exploring Machine Learning techniques and building learning models
                that can be applied to find crime patterns as part of my Masters' thesis.
