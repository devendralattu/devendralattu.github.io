            <p>
                I recently graduated with a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.
                I have 2.5 years of professional software development experience using Agile and with a firm hold on Data Structures and Algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have worked with many different types of software and coding, including Java, Python, Javascript, MEAN stack, SQL,
                and Machine Learning. Recently, as an Intern, I have designed a cloud based sandboxing tool using RESTful API.
                I have also worked on developing database schemas, multi-threading components, web-crawlers, web components.
                I am a motivated coder by heart who enjoys beating the run-time of solutions on Leetcode and answering to StackOverflow posts.

                With this distinct knowledge, I firmly believe that I can be a great asset to a company's software engineering department.
                I am passionate about scaling distributed systems, design patterns, and developing large volume and high user centric applications.
                I am eager to discuss my skill-set and how they will contribute to a career as a Software Engineer.
