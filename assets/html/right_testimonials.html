                        Devendra is a fun to work with guy. However when it comes to work he is as much serious.
                        He was always curious about new things that he can get his hands into,
                        rather innovative towards it. He worked on some of the complex implementation including
                        Automation of crawling, Reporting and Autorefresh.
